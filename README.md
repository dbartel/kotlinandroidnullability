# kotlinandroidnullability
A simple Android App Exercise which allows fixing some nullability errors to learn Kotlin programming.

## NOTES
- For now Gradle build environment is setup for [Android Studio 3.0 Preview - Canary 8](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/index
.html)
- feature/solution branch has a solution (I am also learning!).

## Instructions
- There are some *.kt (Kotlin source) files with intentional compiler errors and lint warnings
- In Android Studio, use **Find in Path (Shift-Cmd-F)** to look for **FIXME** and look for contextual instructions there.

## Here is a list of files with errors
- MainActivity.kt
- AddressAdapter.kt
